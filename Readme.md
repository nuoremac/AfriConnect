Project Title

# AfriConnect
A collaborative platform for African Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to connect, share resources, and amplify their collective impact.

# üåü Inspiration

    We were inspired as upcoming computer engineers by a simple yet profound need: to bridge the gap between thousands of CSOs in Africa who share a common mission but lack the means to connect and collaborate. Our project, **AfriConnect**, is a direct response, building a digital nexus where partnerships are born and collective action thrives.

# üöÄ Key Features

    CSO Profiles: Detailed and searchable profiles that allow organizations to showcase their work, mission, and needs to a wider audience.

	Targeted Discovery: A powerful search and filter system that enables CSOs to find ideal partners based on their area of focus, geographic location, and specific project requirements.

	Collaboration Requests: An in-platform messaging feature to facilitate direct communication, turning a potential connection into a tangible partnership.

# üíª Technologies Used

	Frontend: React ‚öõÔ∏è

	Backend: Node.js & Express

	Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

    Version Control: Git & GitHub

# üéØ How It Works

The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:

    The React frontend provides a dynamic user interface for CSOs.

    The Node.js/Express backend acts as a lightweight API layer for handling custom requests.

    Supabase serves as the central data hub, managing user authentication and securely storing all CSO and collaboration data.

‚û°Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

    Clone the repository:
    git clone [Your GitHub Repo URL]
    cd [Your Project Name]

    Set up Supabase:

        Create a free Supabase account and a new project.

        Find your API URL and keys in the project settings.

        Create a .env file in your root directory with your keys:
        REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=[Your Supabase URL]
        REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[Your Supabase Anon Key]

    Install & Run:

        npm install (in the root directory to install all dependencies)

        npm start

The application will now be running on http://localhost:3001.

# üîÆ Future Vision

This prototype is just the beginning. We envision a future where AfriConnect expands to include:

    A "Call for Collaboration" board where CSOs can post specific needs.

    A centralized, searchable document and resource library.

    Robust user authentication and profile management.

    Tools for tracking the impact of collaborations.
